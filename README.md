SOURCES
I used the TStack.h file from our class lecture as a reference to help me create the MonoStack class. 
Additionally, I used Chat GPT as a debugging tool and to help me with formatting issues because I was 
having trouble with printing the numbers with only 1 decimal place since they are floats. Therefore, 
it taught me how to use std::fixed and std::setprecision using iomanip and sstream.
Here are the following links I used reference (also listed in the code file):
    - TStack.h
